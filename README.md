Solutions for cses.fi problem sets
- No partial solutions; all solutions pass all tests
- All solutions will be in C++17, perhaps Rust in the future
- Will be updated as I complete more solutions, currently working through Dynamic Programming!!

üõ†Ô∏è Compile and Run
To compile and run any of the C++ solutions in this repository, use the following commands:

'''
bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o solution solution.cpp
./solution.exe // Windows/WSL
./solution // Linux/macOS
